Solution overview
</h2>

The Agent for HR Service is designed to assist employees with various HR-related tasks. It provides instant answers, seamless record updates, and automated support, improving efficiency, compliance, and transparency by streamlining HR service workflows. 

This accelerator leverages Copilot Studio, Power Platform, and Microsoft Teams. It also interfaces with Dataverse and integrates the 3rd party business workflow management program, ServiceNow. 

The Agent enables employees to propose a relocation, compare benefits and compensation in different cities, and track the approval process. Upon completion of the relocation process, the company's records are updated and an automation is triggered wherein the Agent for HR Service will reach out for the employee's feedback, all using natural language inside of Microsoft Teams. 

**Note:** This accelerator is not intended to be a production ready solution. The components can be extended through customization and configuration as desired to create a production ready solution. All components packaged have been done through an unmanaged solution, which allows users to be able to customize and extend the components post-deployment. 

### Solution architecture

### How to customize

This solution is designed to be easily customizable. All configuration and customizations to this solution will be done in Power Platform, Copilot Studio, and with content and data stored in 3rd party platform ServiceNow.

**Additional opportunities for extension**

There are a variety of opportunities to extend the functionality of this accelerator. Some of these include:

 * Augmenting the sequence of steps involved in the relocation process, to match organizational practices
 * Catering for additional HR-related processes beyond relocations
 * Adapting or augmenting approval logic to match organizational practices
 * Integrating with additional systems of record for HR-related data and content
 * Integrating eSignature capabilities for document acceptance
    * An example of eSignature integration can be seen in the [Agent for Contract Processing Solution Accelerator](https://github.com/microsoft/Agent-for-Contract-Processing-Solution-Accelerator)

Business Use Case
</h2>

Below is a sample landing page of the solution accelerator after it is deployed, set up, and ready to be used:

![Key Features](./Deployment/Images/landingpage.png)

Pier, an employee of Contoso, is looking to relocate to a new city. Pier initiates contact with the HR agent to understand the relocation process and its potential impacts. The agent provides information on relocation compensation and helps Pier assess the financial implications. The agent offers to initialize a relocation request. Pier submits a relocation request through the agent. The HR team reviews and approves the request. Pier receives a notification in the Teams channel about the approval. The agent generates necessary documents for the relocation process. After the relocation process is complete, Pier receives an autonomous satisfaction survey to provide feedback on the interaction with the HR agent and the overall process

**Highlights**
- Knowledge Retrieval: The agent retrieves relevant information and documents from various sources, including SharePoint and ServiceNow
- Action Execution: The agent performs actions such as initiating requests, generating documents, and sending notifications
- System Integration: The agent integrates with existing HR systems like Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, and ServiceNow to provide a seamless experience. The agent can be customized to handle various HR scenarios, such as onboarding, offboarding, talent development, and performance management 

Overall, the HR Agent helps Pier by providing instant answers, automating routine tasks, and ensuring seamless integration with existing HR systems, thereby enhancing efficiency and the overall employee experience.

### Security guidelines

You may want to ensure that you configure any Copilot Studio actions, and any Connections used in Power automate flows, to use the authentication that is appropriate for your organization and scenario.

Depending on your desired security model, you may wish to select user authentication for actions rather than agent author authentication. For power automate flows, you may wish to configure connections to use the credentials of run-only users, or with a specific connection that you create.

Please note that this solution leverages a custom Dataverse table called 'Relocations' which stores metadata related to the status of employees. Creation of a security role to manage users and relocation table access for end users is recommended based on organizational best practices and needs.

Also note that this solution leverages a SharePoint site and document library for the storage of unsigned, signed, and template NDA Agreements. Ensure that the security settings for your site and library are managed in accordance with your organizational best practices and needs. See [Managing SharePoint Online Security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/community/sharepoint-security-a-team-effort) for more details.
